# Linked-list

Linkedlist is a linear data structure where each elements is a sepearated object.

Created a program for two types of linked list: single and double linkkedlist.

In single linkedlist, I have created two classe, the first class we create the node and second class has the head instance and many methods for linkedlist operations like adding and removing.
