# Linked-list

Linkedlist is a linear data structure where each elements is a sepearated object.

I have created a program for two types of linked list: single and double linkedlist.

In single linkedlist, I have created two classe, the first class create the node or the object and second class has the pointer as a instance variable (head) and many methods for linkedlist operations like adding and removing.
